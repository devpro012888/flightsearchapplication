# Flight Search Application
<h1>Week 7 Assignment</h1>
<p>Create a RESTful web service to authenticate users with their username and password. It should also allow users to register a new account. For this activity, you should be using a local XML file for storing user information. Write code to perform the following tasks:</p>
<u>
<li>Write a RESTful web service that accepts user credentials, checks the local XML file to see if the user is valid, and returns status.</li>
<li>Enhance the RESTful web service to allow user registrations. The API should accept user information, persist the information to the local XML file, and return the status.</li>
</u>
<br>
<p>Note: The local file should be XML only.</p>




<h1>Week 6 Assignment</h1>
<p>In Milestone Two, you will build a RESTful service that works as a travel API service. You can also use any public travel API service instead, such as SkyPicker API. This milestone will focus on ensuring that you are able to create and use RESTful web services within your application. Submit efficient and bug- free code that contains your source code and test files that demonstrate that your application components are able to interact together. Ensure that detailed comments are present in your source code.</p>

<p>This milestone requires you to create a database for storing and retrieving the flight information. If you chose to use a public travel API service instead, you can skip this step.</p>
